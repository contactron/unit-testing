# Udacity Front-End Nanondegree Feedreader Project

## Project Description

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


## Running Instructions

This project can be found in the GitHub repository:
https://github.com/contactron/unit-testing.git

To run the application clone or download the repository to your local machine. Then simply double-click on the index.html file in main directly.

## Unit Test Output

When you run the application it will load and then execute the Jasmine tests. The test results are displayed at the bottom of the page.
